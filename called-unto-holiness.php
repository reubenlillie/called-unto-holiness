			Walking with Jesus in garments of white;
			Raiment unsullied, nor tarnished with sin;
			God\'s Holy Spirit abiding within.
			"Called unto holiness," praise his dear name!
			This blessed secret to faith now made plain,
			Not our own righteousness, but Christ within,
			Living and reigning and saving from sin.
			"Called unto holiness," Bride of the Lamb,
			Waiting the Bridegroom\'s returning again;
			Lift up your heads, for the day draweth near
			When in his beauty the King shall appear.
			"Holiness unto the Lord" is our watchword and song.
			"Holiness unto the Lord" as weâ€™re marching along.
			Sing it, shout it, loud and long,
			"Holiness unto the Lord," now and forever.'
