This is not just a plugin, it symbolizes the hope and enthusiasm generations of Nazarenes inherit through singing "Holiness unto the Lord."

== Description ==

This is not just a plugin, it symbolizes the hope and enthusiasm which the earliest Nazarenes have passed down for generations through each verse of Lelia N. Morris' anthem "Holiness unto the Lord" (1904). When activated you will see a randomly selected lyric from "Holiness unto the Lord" in the upper right of your admin screen on every page.

Taking cues from [Matt Mullenwig's](http://ma.tt/ "Check out Matt Mullenwig's blog site") primordial WordPress plugin, ["Hello Dolly"](https://wordpress.org/plugins/hello-dolly/ "Look up 'Hello Dolly' in the WordPress Plugin Directory"), *Called Unto Holiness* serves as its own "call to action" to keep [me](https://reubenlillie.com/about/ "Connect with me, Reuben L. Lillie, on my personal blog") humble and to infuse our WordPress admin areas with a small piece of identity and purpose.

To install **Called Unto Holiness**:

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/called-unto-holiness` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly

== Lyrics ==

= Verse 1 =

> "Called unto holiness," church of our God,

> Purchase of Jesus, redeemed by his blood;

> Called from the world and its idols to flee,

> Called from the bondage of sin to be free.

= Verse 2 =

> "Called unto holiness," children of light,

> Walking with Jesus in garments of white;

> Raiment unsullied, nor tarnished with sin;

> God's Holy Spirit abiding within.

= Verse 3 =

> "Called unto holiness," praise his dear name!

> This blessed secret to faith now made plain,

> Not our own righteousness, but Christ within,

> Living and reigning and saving from sin.

= Verse 4 =

> "Called unto holiness," Bride of the Lamb,

> Waiting the Bridegroom's returning again;

> Lift up your heads, for the day draweth near

> When in his beauty the King shall appear.

= Refrain =

> _"Holiness unto the Lord" is our watchword and song._

> _"Holiness unto the Lord" as weâ€™re marching along._

> _Sing it, shout it, loud and long,_

> _"Holiness unto the Lord," now and forever.'_
